"With our enormous caseload of administrative appeals, the Center has a unique database that allows us to identify patterns of improper Medicare denials and barriers to a fair appeal process. "

Our colleagues at the Medicare Rights Center have generally looked more closely at Part D issues than we have â€“ you can ask *Julie Carter* (LI) there.

re:  Part D - DENIALS - data
David Lipshultz suggested I contact you because I am examining CMS data for Part D Denials  (<https://bityl.co/LQDZ>) and hope to talk to others doing same or similar.   I write software; do no policy; but do want data to be useful.   Thx for any thoughts and time.

Part D Denials in Transplants:  https://bityl.co/LQEr
    "In summary, this case series demonstrates a critical flaw in the construct of the Medicare Prescription Drug Program regarding coverage for life-sustaining medications for organ transplant recipients. It is dangerous that Medicare Part D plans are allowed and encouraged to rely solely on select drug compendia when making coverage determinations."
