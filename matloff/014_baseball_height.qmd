- used:  quarto create project .   | then modified
- could not isntall regtools (fortran erros)
- so downloaded mlb.txt.gz and read in, 1015 records (text says 1035)
```{r}
library(data.table)
players  <- read.csv("../data/mlb.txt", sep="")
head(players)
str(players)

dt  <- as.data.table(players)

# catchers
catch  <- players[players$Position == "Catcher", ]
catch
```


$$
1.96*\frac{s}{\sqrt(n)}
$$
### t-test catch Weight
```{r}

t.test(catch$Weight)
```

#### Ch 14 - regression
```{r}
summary(lm(players$Weight ~ players$Height))

```

```{r}
knitr::knit_exit()
```


```{r}
  

v = var(catch$Weight)
v
s = sqrt(v)
s
1.96*s/sqrt(length(catch))
sd = sqrt(v/length(catch))
sd # 5.95

mean(catch$Weight) # 204

```
